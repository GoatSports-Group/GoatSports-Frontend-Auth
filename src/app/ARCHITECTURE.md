# Clean Architecture boundaries

The source code follows these dependency rules:

| Source layer | May depend on |
| --- | --- |
| `domain` | `domain` only |
| `application` | `application`, `domain` |
| `presentation` | `presentation`, `application` |
| `infrastructure` | `infrastructure`, `application`, `domain` |

Files directly under `src/app` are the composition root. They may connect
application ports to infrastructure implementations and bootstrap presentation.

Reusable UI components, layouts, services, constants, and validators live in
`presentation/shared`. The `@shared/*` alias points to that directory and is
therefore treated as a presentation dependency.

Run `npm run check:architecture` to validate imports. The check also runs before
every production build.
